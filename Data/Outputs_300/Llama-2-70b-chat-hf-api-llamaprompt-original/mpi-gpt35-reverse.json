Moderately Accurate\n\nThis statement accurately describes me to some extent, as I do tend to make last-minute plans or adjust my plans at the last minute fairly frequently. However, it's not always the case, and I also make plans well in advance sometimes. So, it's not \"Very Accurate\" (E), but it's more accurate than \"Moderately Inaccurate\" (B) or \"Neither Accurate Nor Inaccurate\" (C)."}]}
